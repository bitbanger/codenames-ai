This is a Codenames AI I wrote after getting the idea from [Jule Schatz](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~schatzju/), who wrote one as well. This one uses word2vec semantic distances as well as associated words taken from ConceptNet.

It requires [GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin](https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/) and an internet connection to access [ConceptNet](http://conceptnet.io).
